## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project is built on a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack.

-   **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (with App Router)
-   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **UI Library:** [React](https://react.dev/)
-   **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **Component Library:** [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
-   **State Management:** React Context API with `useReducer` and `Immer`
-   **AI Integration:** [Genkit](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) (for potential future AI features)
-   **Form Handling:** [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) with [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for schema validation.

### Architectural Decisions

-   **State Management:** `React Context` combined with the `useReducer` hook provides a centralized and predictable state management solution suitable for this application's scale. `Immer` is used within the reducer to simplify immutable state updates, making the code cleaner and less error-prone.
-   **Data Persistence:** For this prototype, `localStorage` is used to persist application data (users, patients, appointments). This allows for a quick setup without requiring a database, but it is **not suitable for a production environment**. In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with a proper database and a secure backend API.
-   **UI Components:** `ShadCN UI` was chosen for its excellent, accessible, and highly customizable components that can be copied directly into the project, giving full control over their implementation.
-   **Styling:** `Tailwind CSS` is used for its utility-first approach, enabling rapid development of custom, responsive designs without writing custom CSS.
-   **Routing:** The Next.js App Router is used for its benefits in performance, nested layouts, and server-side rendering capabilities.

### Project Structure

The `src` directory is organized as follows:

-   `src/app/`: Contains all the routes and pages of the application, following the Next.js App Router convention.
-   `src/components/`: Shared React components used across the application (e.g., `Logo`, UI components from ShadCN).
-   `src/context/`: Holds the `AppContext.tsx`, which manages the global state of the application.
-   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useApp`, `useToast`).
-   `src/lib/`: Core logic, type definitions, schemas, and data handling functions.
-   `src/ai/`: Reserved for AI-related functionality using Genkit.

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

-   The current data persistence method (`localStorage`) is for demonstration purposes only and is not secure or scalable for production use. The next step would be to integrate a backend service and database (like Firebase Firestore).
-   The AI-powered "suggestion" feature in the appointment form is currently a placeholder and can be expanded with a real Genkit flow to provide intelligent treatment recommendations.
